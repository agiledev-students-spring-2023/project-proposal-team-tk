# Project Proposal: We Pay

Tony Kim

### Project Title
WePay

### What and Why?

Dutch pay, which means to split the bill for what each individual is responsible for, is something that happens quiet often especially for college students in New York where there are so many good restaurants to explore. But sometimes it can be a hassle to calculate what each person owes the other after a nice meal when everyone got different kinds of food ranging in prices. WePay will help you create groups with your friends and let you keep track of the payments that were made and make sure everyone is charged fairly.

### For Whom?

WePay can be used by any students and adults who enjoy going out with their friends or family and do all kinds of activity. This app is not only limited to restaurants but can be used for anything that involves paying! The app is great for anyone who is looking for a little convinience outside when having fun. For example, trips with friends, which requires keeping track of expenses from many days.

### How?

* Login/Create Account to add friends who you go out with a lot
* Create group(s) with a group name you would like
* Add/invite members to the group whom you will be dutch paying with
* Add event and the total expense that was spent
* within the event, add what each group member bought, price of it, and tax and tip if necessary
* View the owe panel with payment instances to be made to see who owes what and remove each instances when the payment has been complete
* Notify both you and the friend if one of you owe the other after a few days

### Scope

For the purpose of the app, which highlights convinience, the process of the front-end work will take a few weeks to make it accessible and nice for anyone to easily use. The design and accessiblity is a very important part of the project, which will take a lot of thoughts and effort of the group. Then the back-end work of adding the login system, friends system, and the notification system to tie it back nicely with the front-end work will also take a while to work on. Although the project is very straight forward with not many features initially, the challenges along the way of programming will be enough for the semester to help the group improve to be better developers.
